# Jython for BigData
<hr>
As the Software Dev Manager over Data Services, at Ancestry, I'm an advocate of using Jython for BigData eco-system integration projects.
<p>
The main reason is development velocity and productivity clearly established by Python.<br>
<p>
Additional justifications...

* Ease of access to all Java library packages. Thus, no vias such as thrift are required.

* For long running programs, Python on the JVM is performant.

* Jython can leverage existing CPython modules.

* Script, test, script, test... no long compiles and builds required.

<p>
Drop me a line if you find any of this useful, or if you have any constructive comments or insights.
