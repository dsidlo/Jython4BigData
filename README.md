# Jython shell scripts for BigData
<hr>
I'm an advocate of using Jython for BigData eco-system integration projects.
<p>
The main reason is development velocity and productivity clearly established by Python.<br>
<p>
Additional justifications...
* Ease of access to all Java library packages.
* For long running programs, Python on the JVM is performant.
* Jython can leverage existing CPython modules.
* Script, test, script, test... no long compiles and builds required.
